# BSc Thesis Evolution of strength of an initiation subduction zone from quartz microstructures

Thesis for my BSc Earth Sciences at Utrecht University. This project looks at the strength of a paleo subducting plate interface. 

File "GOS_threshold_analysis.py" calculates the internal misorientation threshold angle between relict and recrystallized grains.

File "grainsize_plot.py" creates a bar chart displaying grain size measured via different methods.

File "stress_grainsize_plot.py" creates a plot that shows paleostress as a function of grain size for different grain size measurement techniques and piezometric calibrations.

File "stress_subgrainsize_1deg_plot.py" creates a plot that shows paleostress as a function of subgrain size with a 1° subgrain boundary angle for different subgrain size measurement techniques and piezometric calibrations.

File "stress_subgrainsize_2deg_plot.py" creates a plot that shows paleostress as a function of subgrain size with a 2° subgrain boundary angle for different subgrain size measurement techniques and piezometric calibrations.

File "strainrate_temperature_plot.py" calculates strain rate as a function of temperature for different stress domains. 

File "viscosity_strainrate_stress_plot.py" calculates strain rate as a function of stress for different viscosity values.
